### Background


Climate change refers to the potential climate consequences of increased greenhouse gas emissions (hereinafter GHGE). To prevent potential high costs in socioeconomic losses and keep human lives safe. Governments around the world have launched mitigation and adaptation policies to reduce carbon emissions. In setting targets for climate change policy, the European Union (EU) has translated international commitments into emission reduction responsibilities/missions for each member state since the Kyoto Protocol. However, the EU strategy has resulted in 'high costs and low effectiveness' in terms of overall world carbon emissions for various reasons. In December 2019, the European Commission published the European Green Deal, which implements the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aims to transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient economy, achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions and decoupling economic growth from resource consumption by 2050. At the same time, the Deal also proposed the first European Climate Law, which was subsequently agreed upon by the EU Council and the European Parliament in May 2021. The Act sets a target of reducing the EU's net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

(Green Deal has three main directions: firstly, to promote the transition of the EU economy towards sustainable development (specific climate change measures), secondly, to promote global sustainable development as a global leader (financing schemes and technology export), and thirdly, to introduce a European Climate Convention to promote public participation and commitment)


### 	Research objectives
This paper attempts to analyze the main obstacles to the implementation of the European Green Deal policies and attempts to analyze their solutions. Using a Data study, this paper gathers the general framework of the Green Deal with three directions and streamlines the eight climate policy measures in Direction one. Also, identify the potential carbon leakage issues arising from measure I. & III. which include target legislation, strict digital regulation, carbon allowance, carbon trade and transformation of high carbon industries. And core technical constraints in new energy development from II., include renewable energy transition and energy storage. As well as the funding gap issue that exists across all remaining measures. Two solutions are proposed for the above obstacles, which are Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Super Grid Direct Energy Storage.

 

### 	Outcomes
##### 8 Measures

Providing clean, affordable and secure energy: promoting decarbonization of the natural gas sector, proposing the European Energy Network TEN-E framework (an integrated system of transportation, telecommunications and energy networks), providing funding to solve energy poverty, developing the storage and use of alternative fuels such as clean hydrogen, develop technologies related to carbon capture, promote value investment in battery-based technologies

III. Driving the transition of high carbon industry to a clean recycling economy: promoting market leadership for sustainable products, decarbonization of energy-intensive industries, encouraging resource-intensive industries to re-utilizing resources and recycling commodities, strengthening digital regulation and digital technology applications, reducing industrial waste, development of waste recycling routes, the introduction of waste separation, carbon trading over the emission allowances.

IV. Constructing and renovating buildings with high performance and resource efficiency： Implementation of the new law, amendments to the old law, attempts to include building emissions in carbon trading, new financing scheme

V. sustainable and smart transport: encourage multi-modal transport, publish smart transport management systems, link transport prices to environmental impact, build million new electric charging stations, strict enforcement of transport pollution, the transition of transport to electricity

VI.  Sustainable food systems: farm-to-table strategy, 40% agricultural policy budget and 30% fisheries fund for climate change activities, reduction of chemical pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics, promotion of sustainable food consumption, a ban on substandard imported food

VII.  Conservation and restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity: biodiversity strategies, the establishment of relevant legislation, provision of financing, forest restoration, stringent law enforcement

VIII. Ambition to achieve zero pollution in a non-toxic environment： a sustainable chemical strategy, strict regulation of industrial pollution, start zero air, water and soil pollution plan

##### Obstacles
This paper examines the obstacles to the agreement by analyzing the various policies presented in Part 1. Three major obstacles are identified. The first obstacle is the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which aims to address the issue of carbon leakage. However, the implementation of CBAM has several details that are not conducive to local enterprises being competitive, and it needs to be refined in practice. Additionally, CBAM can potentially increase the cost of living for the domestic population.

The second obstacle is the core technology barrier of renewable energy, which is being addressed through the super grid program. This initiative directly connects smart grids to different generation and energy storage facilities. However, the program is costly, multi-country, difficult to implement, and requires high technical and security requirements.

The third obstacle pertains to the funding gap. The European Commission in June 2019 expected that €500 billion per year (€5000 billion in total by 2030) would no longer be sufficient, which represents an additional investment required, which has not yet been quantified. From a macro perspective, the concomitant issue with the Green Deal is that Europe's contribution to global emissions is less than 4 billion tonnes, which is only 10% of global emissions in percentage terms. 

### Possible solutions

#### Carbon leakage

The most effective solution to the problem of carbon leakage is the implementation of a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). This involves levying taxes or refunding carbon quotas on imported or exported high-carbon products to ensure compliance with domestic climate policies. CBAM can address the issue of enterprise shifting and maintain the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, thereby reducing the risk of carbon leakage and pushing other countries to adopt stricter climate policies. Although CBAM has been a topic of discussion at international climate negotiations, it has been a controversial measure. While proponents argue that CBAM reduces the aforementioned risks, opponents claim that it is a form of protectionism. Furthermore, some high-carbon industries within the EU are concerned about the potential loss of free allowances for sectors already covered by the EU carbon market and the loss of competitive advantage.

CBAM has been under discussion in the EU since the establishment of carbon trading in 2005. In July 2021, the EU Commission proposed CBAM legislation that includes cement, steel, electricity, aluminium, and fertilizer as the first sectors to be included, with a transition period lasting from 2023 to 2025. During this period, importers in these sectors will not be required to pay a fee but will be required to provide information on the imported products, including their volume, country of origin, carbon emissions and indirect emissions, and the carbon price paid for the products in the source country. After the transition period, importers will be required to pay for the emissions of the products they import, and the EU will consider whether to expand the scope of the sectors covered by CBAM.

Although CBAM can address the issue of carbon leakage, there are still concerns about its potential consequences. The existing research has mainly focused on the benefits and drawbacks for industries and has not considered the impact on the commodity market. When countries with strict climate measures impose carbon tariffs, how will they cope with the expected price increases in domestic commodity markets? Could this cause threats to the lives and health of the population, and lead to significant unemployment or social unrest in those commodity-exporting countries? These are important questions that need to be considered in the ongoing discussions around CBAM.

#### Core technologies
The discontinuity, instability, difficulty of transport/exchange, storage, and geographical limitations of new energy sources highlight the necessity for technological innovation, specifically the super grid. A super grid is an intelligent hybrid AC/DC wide-area power transmission network that relies on long-distance distribution facilities. It can connect various power generation systems and transmit significant amounts of electricity. This innovative technology allows for loading electricity several kilometres away with minimal losses and maximum efficiency. Additionally, it comes equipped with a digital energy management system, which enables the super grid to control, manage, and optimize transmission grids, microgrids, and multiple generation units for fast response and security of the whole power system (de Rubens, et al., 2019).

Supported by the EU, 10 multinational enterprises have established a partnership with the Super Grid (FOSG) to promote the intelligence of the European grid and strengthen interconnections across regions. According to the FOSG report in 2016, the future direction of transmission technology in Europe is the direct current grid. The report also emphasizes the importance of large-scale energy storage technologies in super grids to ensure a stable, balanced system. However, although new energy storage technologies such as hydrogen and methane production technology have been developed and applied in Germany, they are still in the early stages of industrialization and currently have low efficiency and high costs, requiring longer operational validation (Schiebahn, S., et al., 2015).

Furthermore, the connection of renewable energy sources to the grid poses a challenge due to their uncertain output and variety, which can impact the voltage, frequency, and damping of the system, making grid security a significant challenge. This requires an intelligent digital management system to monitor the dynamic processes of the power system in real-time, analyze the grid's dynamic characteristics, detect faults, and solve them promptly to achieve safe, stable, and optimized operation of the super grid. However, due to financial and cross-border transmission mechanisms, the EU has not been able to promote super-DC grids successfully (Wei, 2021). Even though there is a special fund to support the construction of the super grid, many projects still need to be financed by individual organizations.

Overall, the security risks associated with super grids are high, and it is crucial to discuss how to ensure that the lives of people in the surrounding areas are not affected. Furthermore, permanent maintenance and management of the grid system by professional technicians are necessary to ensure its smooth operation.

#### Funding gap

For the target of a 55% reduction in GHGE in 2030 set by the Green Deal, the European Commission in June 2019 expected that €500 billion per year (€5000 billion in total by 2030) would no longer be sufficient, which represents an additional investment required, which has not yet been quantified. This paper investigates the specific measures under the Green Deal to calculate the gap, firstly relating to the aforementioned replacement of conventional power generation by renewable sources. The substitution plan calls for doubling renewable energy generation by 2030 to help meet its emissions reduction targets. According to a study by the consultancy AT Kearney, annual renewable energy investments in Europe will increase from €60 billion in 2020 to €90 billion in 2022. By 2030, Europe's total investment in wind and solar energy will reach at least €650 billion, and could reach €1 trillion (Flauger, J. & Witsch, k., 2021). According to V., the transition of transport to electricity is a core element of the Green Deal, which provides for at least 30 million zero-emission vehicles on European roads by 2030. And double the number of regular public transport journeys of less than 500 km including high-speed rail. Infrastructure deployment is estimated at €130 billion per year. The investment gap will add to €100 billion per year. To complete the TEN-T core network and build it into a true multi-modal transport system alone, €300 billion will be needed over the next 10 years (European Union, 2021). About II., energy storage. The cost of using renewable electricity for hydroelectricity (hydrogen energy, as mentioned earlier) decreasing every year, but is still seven times higher than fossil fuels. The EU aims to increase the share of hydrogen in the EU energy structure from less than 2% today to 13-14% by 2050. To support this, the European Commission estimates that the carbon price under the EU-ETS would need to rise from the current level of around €30 per ton to €55-90 per ton. It also plans €66 billion for electrolyzer expansion, €560 billion for renewable energy expansion, €11 billion for retrofitting existing plants and €65 billion for hydrogen transport, distribution and storage, including hydrogen refuelling stations (ICIS Editorial, 2021). From IV., around three-quarters of the EU's 220 million buildings are considered to be inefficient. Given that buildings account for 36% of the EU's GHGE (overlapping with the 75% for electricity generation in the previous section) and 40% of energy consumption, the EU's Covid-19 recovery plan will invest towards upgrading them. The plan's main objectives call for a 60% reduction in GHGE from buildings by 2030 and an 18% reduction in the energy used for heating and cooling. To achieve this, it aims to double the rate of renovation of buildings to 2% over the next ten years, which will require an annual investment of €275 billion (European Commission., 2020). These are the main investments under the European Green Deal, and although there is a slight overlap between them, they are still twice as high as the original 500 billion per year. This paper enquires into the current solutions to the funding gap but does not find effective and reasonable measures. The aforementioned carbon border tax could bring in €14 billion per year, but it falls far short of filling the huge gap. The EU's proposed solution is to allocate 25% budget from every program/project each year as an additional budget for climate change policies or use in internal carbon problems led by their project. But this could probably be solved by central banks printing money endlessly and lending it to governments, and when all central banks around the world make the same move, there is no need to worry about the collapse of the financial system, the pressure will just be slowly passed on to the people. Having the people pay for this funding gap again seems equivalent to another breathing tax. But global warming is indeed a serious issue for every living being on this planet, and we cannot judge the rightness or wrongness of these actions.
