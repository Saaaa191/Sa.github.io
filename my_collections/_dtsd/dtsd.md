- Open networks orientated towards learning (hierarchical organizations)
- Focus on continuous improvement (fixed process)
- Increased freedoms for individual actors (hourglass organizations with significant barriers to participation/influence).
- Focus on sharing and collaboration (brand definition)
- People engaged as skill entrepreneurs (labour/skill provider) 

 

###  Policy Framework 

##### **●Key technocratic elements (the bound) of the policy proposal**

○Establishment of a skills framework

○Strong focus on gender inclusivity

○Strong focus on the use of technology in teaching

○Establishment of open networks to achieve the above out comes



**●Key principles and values elements (the binding) of the policy proposal**

○Life long learning

○Micro-credentialling

○An overt egalitarian democratic ethos
### Policy Sustainability
The analysis is based on the following process

1. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, power structure, rules, its culture — arises.

2. The goals of the system.

3. The distribution of power over the rules of the system.

4. The rules of the system (incentives, punishments, constraints).

5. Information flows.

6. Material flows and nodes of material intersection.

7. Driving positive feedback loops.

8. Regulating negative feedback loops.

9. Constants, parameters, numbers (subsidies, taxes, standards).

###  	Outcomes


**1.1 Establishment of overt egalitarian democratic ethos (& 2.4 digital skills network)**

Recommendation one: The BSL should gain industry support and promote to the Australian Commonwealth Government to establish an open-network of people (both individuals and organizational representatives) who will act as central advisory body to government. The group should be established in such a way to be accessible to any individual that wishes to be involved and have mechanisms in place to prevent large tech from monopolizing discourse and vote stacking.

**1.2&1.3 Reconfiguration of Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) to recognize mini/micro-credentialling**

Recommendation two: The BSL should advocate to the Australian Commonwealth Government consider revising the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) to recognize micro credentialling across the AQF levels as they relate to digital skills. Further the BSL should advocate for the digital skills network to undertake establishment and stewardship of the digital skills framework.

**2.1, 2.4, 2.5 & 2.11 Establishment of a skills framework and skill network and lifelong learning**

Recommendation three: The BSL should advocate for the implementation of a framework that establishes the skills required by industry which is in turn mapped to the mini/micro-credentialling of the AQF. Further the BSL should advocate for the digital skills network to be hold stewardship of the skills framework. The framework and network shall serve for encouraging people update their skills in their whole life.

**2.2 Focus on the use of technology in teaching**

Recommendation four: The BSL should advocate for introducing more new technologies such as online teaching platform and AR/VR in education and training to introduce more practical scenario in teaching and improve the sufficiency.

**2.3&2.6 Develop programs to attract more students to study IT technologies in VET and higher education**

Recommendation five: The BSL should advocate to the Australian Commonwealth Government and local governments to establish more scholarships and rewards for IT students have outstanding performance in VET and higher education to make IT more attractive to students. Further the BSL should advocate for the establishment of the pathways from secondary education to VET and higher education to remove the barriers in entering digital skills learning.

**2.7 & 2.10 Promotion of STEM professions to diverse gender identifies Focus on gender inclusivity**

Recommendation six: The BSL should advocate to identify the gender imbalance in digital sector and encourage women to participate in digital industry. The most important thing is to remove cultural barriers such as biases and stereotypes for women ICT specialists. Thus, the BSL should advocate medias to present more women ICT specialists to encourage more women to participate in ICT industry.

**2.8 Establish grants program to promote digital sector**
