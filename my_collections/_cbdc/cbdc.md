### China's social credit system combined with the central bank's digital currency: The Practice of Control


In China, the government is currently running the Social Credit System (SCS) in several cities, a policy that attempts to integrate financial credit systems and the quantified data of all citizens and companies broadly. China's SCS combines big data and algorithmic models to create a new form of Chinese government authority, which has the potential to create a new-level social inequality and individual freedom restriction. Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced the launch of testing a central bank digital currency, E-CNY; and a Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) policy, which will be based on the existing two-tier currency system in circulation. DCEP represents the most liquid form of money supply, the same as socially circulating paper money and coins, M0, but in digital form. Furthermore, DCEP does not fit into the classical concept of non-decentralized virtual currencies. It has a centralized issuance, a legal status payment method and a mechanism to improve the efficiency of the transmission of monetary policies in China. This proposal attempts to explore how the Chinese social credit system, when combined with the central bank's digital currency, produces an enhanced practice of government control. This topic could clarify the future world's possible emerging societies and structures. Both data authoritarianism and a socialist planned economy are likely to emerge from the combination of these two policies. This paper will use a case study method to solve the problem by establishing the correlation between SCS and DCEP with Alipay and Sesame Credit.

### A national experiment is perfectly hidden under Alipay and Sesame Credit

n China, the government is currently running the Social Credit System (SCS) in several cities, a policy that attempts to integrate financial credit systems and the quantified data of all citizens and companies broadly. The Social Credit System is the most visible reflection of the Chinese government's efforts to strengthen legal, regulatory and policy processes through the application of information technology. China's SCS combines big data and algorithmic models to create a new form of a Chinese government authority. The emergence of this system, which integrates data departments from different government departments to monitor and modify the behaviour of Chinese citizens, has the potential to create a new-level social inequality and individual freedom restriction (Wong, K. L. X., & Dobson, A. S., 2019). Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced the launch of testing a central bank digital currency, E-CNY; and a Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) policy, which will be based on the existing two-tier currency system in circulation. Karen Yeung (2020) stated: 'DCEP represents the most liquid form of money supply, same as socially circulating paper money and coins, M0, but in digital form.' Furthermore, DCEP does not fit into the classical concept of non-decentralized virtual currencies. It has a centralized issuance, a legal status payment method and a mechanism to improve the efficiency of the transmission of monetary policies in China (Volkova, T. et al., 2020). About China's DCEP - a stable currency endorsed by the PBOC at a 1:1 ratio to the legal currency Chinese yuan (CNY). China's DCEP system follows a 'two-tier' rule: firstly, as a sovereign currency, the PBOC is the sole issuer of DCEP. Secondly, to accelerate the currency's circulation, the PBOC will issue DCEP to selected retail banks and non-financial institutions (such as Alibaba, Tencent, and UnionPay) that have strong existing mobile payment networks in China to distribute the currency to the public. Businesses across China are required to accept DCEP as payment by law (Xu, J., & Prud'homme, D., 2020).

SCS consists of a 'Black list' and 'Red list' that supports the system's reward and punishment mechanisms built into the system (Creemers, 2018; Liu, 2017). Citizens who have a high score through doing encouraged behaviour will be placed on the "Red list" and those who do Irregular behaviour have a low score will be placed on the "Black list". The blacklist limits the amount of money spent, restricts spending scenarios and restricts loans (Creemers, 2018). The Chinese government intends to customize a score for each citizen's behaviour and link it to their identity card to establish a unified social credit system (Yin, 2014). In turn, the use of DCEP can help record residents’ daily money transactions including amount, time, type, scenario, and other data in terms of ‘behaviour’ (Hatton, 2015). When using the state-authorized Sesame Credit as the subject of comparison, SCS may have the same function of rating individuals based on purchase history, types of products purchased, personal information, relationships, timely bill payment, and fulfilment (Botsman, 2017; Greenfield, 2018; Hvistendahl, 2017). Sesame Credit uses these specific effectors in its ratings to try to shape the behaviour of Chinese citizens as it drives individuals away from some actions/purchases and towards others.
