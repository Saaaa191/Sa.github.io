### Climate change policy


The 2015 carbon reduction policy of the Australian government has had a profound impact on the mining industry in the country. The policy aimed to reduce carbon emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by the year 2030. One of the major consequences of the policy was the impact on the coal industry, which was the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. The policy put a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide that these power plants could emit. Consequently, several older and less efficient power plants were compelled to close, directly impacting the coal demand. Moreover, the policy resulted in reduced investment in the coal industry, as investors were apprehensive about the industry's long-term viability. Many companies faced pressure from consumers and shareholders to transition towards cleaner energy sources.

As a result of these factors, the Australian coal industry is predicted to be declining in the futural years. The government of Australia has tried to support the industry through several measures, including funding for research and development of carbon capture and storage technologies. However, the industry still faces significant challenges. The 2015 carbon reduction policy has had a noteworthy impact on the coal mining industry in Australia, which was once a crucial driver of the country's economy. The policy has forced the industry to adapt to changing market conditions and increased pressure to reduce carbon emissions. 

Based on the government's list of emission reduction priorities, it is evident that significant reductions will be made in the transport and mining sectors. This article delves into this matter through data analysis.

### Data

This table depicts a 3-sector economy that excludes external demand. The interpretation of the data shows that the Type I multiplier for the cattle industry is 1.7.
This means that for every 1 change in final demand sales in the local economy, the total direct and indirect impacts on the cattle and sheep sector are $1.7, and vice versa. The sector with the highest Type I multiplier is heavy and civil engineering, with a value of 2.56. The lowest Type I multiplier is in the Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Product Manufacturing sector, with a value of 1.03.

The Type I multipliers explain the value change for an industry when an economy's final demand sales vary per unit. For instance, the Type I multiplier for coal mining is 2.36, meaning that when the final sale changes the value by 1 dollar, the change in its output will be 2.36 directly or indirectly.

Power generation is a crucial component of the coal mining industry since coal mining accounts for approximately 8% of total power generation output. This implies that the coal and mining industries require a significant amount of power. Basic chemical production makes up 0.03% of total output and supports coal and mining.

To estimate the effect of government cuts （climate policy lead） on industry output, we can use the input-output framework formula (I-M)-1*D, where I is the identity matrix, M is the coefficient matrix, and D is the external demand. Using the calculated matrix for (I-M)-1 and the given external demand D, we can determine the original industry output, as presented below.

After the government reduces demand for the "transport and support services industry" (industry no. 22) by 25% and the "oil and gas extraction" industry (industry no. 5) by 30%, represented as D', the "Coal industry" (industry no. 21) is expected to be the most impacted by the proposed government cuts. Its output is projected to decrease by 12.58% compared to its original output level. This outcome can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, as shown by the Type I multiplier matrix provided above, the "Coal industry" has a relatively high Type I multiplier value, which indicates that it is highly sensitive to changes in final demand sales in the local economy. Thus, a government cut will lead to a considerable decline in the industry's output by a monetary amount. Secondly, the original output level for the "Coal industry" is relatively small. Therefore, the decline in monetary value will result in a higher percentage change in output compared to other industries.

The result highlights the vulnerability of the "Coal industry" in Australia when facing volatility in external demand in the local economy. This may necessitate supplementary policies from the Australian government to prevent a severe industrial crisis and significant output decline.

According to the change in percentage in output, the "Coal industry" (industry no. 21) is expected to be the most affected by the proposed government cut, with a projected reduction of 12.58% compared to its original output level. This outcome can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, as illustrated by the Type I multiplier matrix presented above, the "Coal industry" has a relatively high Type I multiplier value, which indicates that it is highly sensitive to changes in final demand sales in the local economy. Consequently, a government cut will result in a significant decline in the industry's output by a monetary amount. Secondly, the original output level for the "Coal industry" is relatively small. Thus, the decline in monetary value will result in a higher percentage change in output compared to other industries.

### Conclusion

In summary, these findings suggest that the "Coal industry" in Australia is susceptible to the impact of external demand volatility, and the proposed government cuts are likely to have a severe effect on the industry's output. Therefore, it may be necessary for the Australian government to introduce additional policies to mitigate the adverse effects of these cuts on the industry.
